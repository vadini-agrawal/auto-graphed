# About this plugin

This is a beta version of an Obsidian plug-in to automatically create connections between your markdown notes via an LLM.

You can input an OpenAI API key and choose a GPT model and it will auto-generate connections between your notes.

Note that we are constrained by the [token limit](https://platform.openai.com/account/limits) of your chosen model.

You have the ability to generate tags and then delete all generated tags if desired.
